Go to package.json and delete dependencies for React

Run  npm install --save-exact react@rc react-dom@rc

to get the latest verison of React that's 19

  "dependencies": {
    "react": "19.0.0-rc.1",
    "react-dom": "19.0.0-rc.1"
  }


npm create vite@latest react-project -- --template react
  npm run install
  npm run dev


main.jsx
What it is doing is? getElementById
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
)

we can delete StrictMode for now
go find 'root' element and render 'App' component

Component is a little building block or piece of our user interface that we are going to describe one part of the application
