Understanding React compiler

code named "React for Git" is one of most anticipitated features in React19

There is React Compiler Playground, to see how your React code goes from a component to a function
https://playground.react.dev/

Compiler takes the code and compiles that's optimized for the browser
Use the playground at playground.react.dev to transform their components to optimized functions.

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <header>
    <h1>Hello New React Compiler!</h1> 
    </header>
  )
  }

  We need to install React Developer tools in Chrome, it tells us whether the page is using React or not

Go to: https://react.dev/
right-click Inspect => Components => it lists the building blocks on this page
Also if you click on "Manage Extensions", we can see React Developer Tools logo filled-in

react.new can also a Code sandbox to code and test React code
