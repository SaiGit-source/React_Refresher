How React works?
Core building block of React is React Elements

React Elements: what we see on the screen like an HTML tag
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello World"); DOM node that displays Hello World

React Apps are made up of React components: React components are one or more React elements nested together. We create a React component using a function
function Header(){
    return <h1>Hello React!</h1>
}

We are using a syntax called as jsx. a tag-based syntax that compiles plain Javascript before we run it in the browser

These components make up the DOM tree

Props: to display dynamic data inside of a component

function Header(props) {
    return <h1>Hello {props.title}!</h1>
}
<Header title="vite" />
